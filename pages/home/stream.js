        Streams are a way of handlling data. Streams in node.js are most widely
        used for file reading and transmissions that are very helpful in sending
        or creating files such as images and pdfs
      </p>
      <p>
        In the core nodejs module fs we are offered with a few methods that are
        used to read and write files such as createReadStream and
        createWriteStream.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are ready the server will send a get request to /stream. If you
        see a download that means the request was a success. Else there was some
        failure
      </p>

export default stream;
