        There is a way of executing javascript in the browser. This is called
        Cross Site Scripting. Intuivitively one can enter this as an input to a
        form:
        <br />
        <br />
        <code>
          {"<script>"}
          <br />
          &emsp;{'alert("I hacked your app")'}
          <br />
          {"</script>"}
        </code>{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
         If this data was stored in an application and displayed it when
        you fetched, you have essentially hacked the application as an alert box
        will pop up.

        Luckily various packages have been developed to prevent this. For
        example{" "}

          target="_blank"

          className="text-blue-400"
        >
          dompurify
        </a>{" "}
        is one that can be used to clean the input entered in a form.
