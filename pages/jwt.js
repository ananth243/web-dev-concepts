   secret that is used to encrypt them. If you have 2 servers using the same user info the same jwt can be used to communicate between them 
   if they are both using the same secret. For more info head to the link below.`;

        JWT

      <p>
        There will be a POST request sent to the server with the following data:
        <br />
        {JSON.stringify({
          name: "John Doe",
          secretPassword: "12345",
        })}
        <br />
        The server will return a JWT. The payload of the jwt will be the
        user&apos;s data as follows:
        <br />
        {JSON.stringify({
          name: "John Doe",
          timestamp: "Date of creation",
        })}
        After this you should also send a GET request to &apos;/api/jwt&apos;.
        The request should include the token in a header called token.
        <br />
        The secret you should use for this entire practice should be test12
